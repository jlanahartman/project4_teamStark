For Project 4, Team Stark dives into the quality and chemistry of wines to help restaurants choose the best wine option for them to provide their customers. Specifically, we analyze Vihno Verde wines based on features such as pH, alcohol content, acidity, chlorides, and sulphites to investigate the wine quality, and to implement a Random Forest Model. This tool will allow users to input various physiochemical values and output predicted wine quality. 

In our website, users are able to choose each specific attribute which results to a specific type of wine. Please see above workbook folders and sheets for how our team made this possible.
